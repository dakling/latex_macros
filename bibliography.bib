Based on this, and further support from large eddy simulations ({LES}) of axisymmetric coflowing round jets with various inlet conditions, we propose that the local value of the variance in the thickness of the boundary layer and thus the velocity distribution at the jet inlet can be used to predict the location of the virtual origin. This, in turn, indicates the inadequacy of the traditionally used length scale, the jet half-width/radius, and suggests the local variance is a length scale with better physical significance. It appears unlikely that the turbulence intensity distribution at the orifice plays a significant role in the determination of the virtual origin or the axial spread of the effective jet width.},

	title = {{AIAA} Formulation of the k-ω Turbulence Model Revisited},
	abstract = {This paper presents a reformulated version of the author's k-ω model of turbulence. Revisions include
addition of just one new closure coefficient and an adjustment to the dependence of eddy viscosity on turbulence
properties. The result is a significantly improved model that applies to both boundary layers and free shear
flows, and that has very little sensitivity to finite freestream boundary conditions on turbulence properties.
The improvements to the k-ω model represent a significant expansion of its range of applicability. The new
model, like preceding versions, provides accurate solutions for mildly-separated flows and simple geometries
such as that of a backward-facing step. The model's improvement over earlier versions lies in its accuracy
for even more complicated separated flows. This paper demonstrates the enhanced capability for supersonic
flow into compression corners and a hypersonic shock/boundary-layer interaction. The excellent agreement
is achieved without introducing any compressibility modifications to the turbulence model.
Background
The k-ω model was created independently first by Kol-
mogorov 1 and later by Saffman. 2 Wilcox 3\{5 has continu-
ally refined and improved the model during the past three
decades and demonstrated its clear superiority to all other
two-equation models. This paper presents the author's lat-
est efforts aimed at improving the model.
The new model incorporates two key modifications,
namely, addition of a {\textbackslash}cross-diffusion" term and a built-in
{\textbackslash}stress-limiter" modification that makes the eddy viscos-
ity a function of k, ω and the ratio of turbulence-energy
production to turbulence-energy dissipation.
The addition of cross diffusion to the ω equation was
first suggested by Speziale 6 as a remedy for the origi-
nal k-ω model's sensitivity to the freestream value of ω.
While Speziale and others, e.g., Menter, 7 Wilcox, 8 Kok 9
and Hellsten 10 have succeeded in using cross-diffusion to
eliminate boundary-condition sensitivity, it has come at the
expense of the ability to make reasonable predictions for
free shear flows. Strictly speaking, models created in this
spirit are limited in applicability to wall-bounded flows.
The stress-limiter modification was introduced by Coak-
ley. 11 Huang 12 shows, in detail, that by limiting the mag-
nitude of the eddy viscosity when turbulence-energy pro-
duction exceeds turbulence-energy dissipation, this modi-
fication yields larger separation bubbles and, most notably,
greatly improves incompressible- and transonic-flow pre-
dictions. Kandula and Wilcox 13 have verified for a tran-
sonic airfoil that it improves predictive accuracy of the
baseline k-ω model without cross diffusion and {\textbackslash}blending
functions" and/or nonlinear constitutive relations such as
those implemented by Menter 7 and Hellsten. 10 In point
of fact, the success achieved in this paper demonstrates
that blending functions add little advantage and counter
the elegance and simplicity of the k-ω model.

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) of incompressible, spatially developing square jets in the Reynolds number range of 500–2000 is reported. The three-dimensional unsteady Navier–Stokes equations are solved using high order spatial and temporal discretization. The objective of the present work is to understand the evolution of free and forced square jets by examining the formation of large-scale structures. Coherent structures and related interactions of free jets suggest control strategies that can be used to achieve enhanced spreading and mixing of the jet with the surrounding fluid. The critical Reynolds number for the onset on unsteadiness in an unperturbed free square jet is found to be 875–900 while it reduces to the range 500–525 in the presence of small-scale perturbations. Disturbances applied at the flow inlet cause saturation of {KH}-instability and early transition to turbulence. Forced jet calculations have been carried out using varicose perturbation with amplitude of 15\%, while frequency is independently varied. Simulations show that the initial development of the square jet is influenced by the four corners leading to the appearance hairpin structures along with the formation of vortex rings. Farther downstream, adjacent vortices strongly interact leading to their rapid breakup. Excitation frequencies in the range 0.4–0.6 cause axis-switching of the jet cross-section. Results show that square jets achieve greater spreading but are less controllable in comparison to the circular ones.},

The evolution of vortical structures reveals the presence of a helical structure in the flow field along with the occurrence of vortex pairing. The time-averaged streamwise velocity distribution shows self-similarity in the far field. The cross-streamwise distribution of the Reynolds stresses also shows weak self-similarity downstream as the flow is not fully developed within the streamwise length of the computational domain. A detailed comparison with experiments is carried out and the computed time-averaged as well as statistical data shows excellent match with the experimental results. Numerical simulation also reveals various transitions during flow evolution in the streamwise direction.},

	abstract = {From round and plane jet experimental data, it can be inferred that the existence of the virtual origin can be attributed to variations in thickness of the internal boundary layer at the orifice. Based on this, and further support from large eddy simulations ({LES}) of axisymmetric coflowing round jets with various inlet conditions, we propose that the local value of the variance in the thickness of the boundary layer and thus the velocity distribution at the jet inlet can be used to predict the location of the virtual origin. This, in turn, indicates the inadequacy of the traditionally used length scale, the jet half-width/radius, and suggests the local variance is a length scale with better physical significance. It appears unlikely that the turbulence intensity distribution at the orifice plays a significant role in the determination of the virtual origin or the axial spread of the effective jet width.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the equations governing homogeneous shear flow shows the possibility of solutions which are self-preserving at all scales of motion, and that these solutions are dependent on the initial conditions. The appropriate velocity scale is the one obtained from the turbulence kinetic energy, q2/2, while the length scale is the Taylor microscale, λ. Two cases of self-preserving flow are identified: one corresponding to constant mean shear, the other to a mean shear which is inversely proportional to time. For the first case (the only one considered in detail) the principal results of the postulated similarity are that λ is constant, while q2 varies exponentially with time. The ratio of the turbulence energy production rate to its dissipation rate remains constant. It is also shown that the energy spectra scale over all wavenumbers with q2 and λ, and that they have shapes determined by the initial conditions. The experimental evidence is generally consistent with the theory.},
