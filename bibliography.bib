	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) of incompressible, spatially developing square jets in the Reynolds number range of 500–2000 is reported. The three-dimensional unsteady {N}avier–{S}tokes equations are solved using high order spatial and temporal discretization. The objective of the present work is to understand the evolution of free and forced square jets by examining the formation of large-scale structures. Coherent structures and related interactions of free jets suggest control strategies that can be used to achieve enhanced spreading and mixing of the jet with the surrounding fluid. The critical Reynolds number for the onset on unsteadiness in an unperturbed free square jet is found to be 875–900 while it reduces to the range 500–525 in the presence of small-scale perturbations. Disturbances applied at the flow inlet cause saturation of {KH}-instability and early transition to turbulence. Forced jet calculations have been carried out using varicose perturbation with amplitude of 15\%, while frequency is independently varied. Simulations show that the initial development of the square jet is influenced by the four corners leading to the appearance hairpin structures along with the formation of vortex rings. Farther downstream, adjacent vortices strongly interact leading to their rapid breakup. Excitation frequencies in the range 0.4–0.6 cause axis-switching of the jet cross-section. Results show that square jets achieve greater spreading but are less controllable in comparison to the circular ones.},

The axisymmetric shear layer rolls up in the near field of the jet forming vortex rings. The rings tilt as they convect downstream before becoming turbulent in the far field. The evolution of vortical structures reveals the presence of a helical structure in the flow field along with the occurrence of vortex pairing. The time-averaged streamwise velocity distribution shows self-similarity in the far field. The cross-streamwise distribution of the Reynolds stresses also shows weak self-similarity downstream as the flow is not fully developed within the streamwise length of the computational domain. A detailed comparison with experiments is carried out and the computed time-averaged as well as statistical data shows excellent match with the experimental results. Numerical simulation also reveals various transitions during flow evolution in the streamwise direction.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the equations governing homogeneous shear flow shows the possibility of solutions which are self-preserving at all scales of motion, and that these solutions are dependent on the initial conditions. The appropriate velocity scale is the one obtained from the turbulence kinetic energy, q2/2, while the length scale is the Taylor microscale, λ. Two cases of self-preserving flow are identified: one corresponding to constant mean shear, the other to a mean shear which is inversely proportional to time. For the first case (the only one considered in detail) the principal results of the postulated similarity are that λ is constant, while q2 varies exponentially with time. The ratio of the turbulence energy production rate to its dissipation rate remains constant. It is also shown that the energy spectra scale over all wavenumbers with q2 and λ, and that they have shapes determined by the initial conditions. The experimental evidence is generally consistent with the theory.},

This model enables the correct kinematic boundary condition to be imposed on the normal component of turbulent intensity. Hence, wall blocking is represented. Means for enforcing the correct boundary conditions on the other components of intensity and on the k --- ɛ equations are discussed. The present model agrees quite well with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The virtue of the present approach is that arbitrary ``damping functions'' are not required.",

abstract = {Four different two-equation turbulence models for geophysical flows are compared: The k–$\varepsilon$ model, two new versions of the k–$\omega$ model, and the Mellor–Yamada model. An extension of the k–$\omega$ model for buoyancy affected and rotating flows is suggested. Model performance is evaluated for a few typical oceanic flows. First, new analytical solutions of the models for the surface layer affected by breaking surface waves are discussed. The deficiencies of earlier attempts are high-lighted, and it is demonstrated why the Mellor–Yamada model and the k–ϵ model fail. It is illustrated that only one version of the k–$\omega$ model computes correct decay rates for turbulent quantities under breaking waves. Second, it is demonstrated that all models predict almost identical mixed layer depths and profiles for the turbulent kinetic energy in a classical stratified shear-entrainment experiment if the buoyancy term in the second equation is appropriately weighted. Third, the accuracy and numerical robustness of the new k–$\omega$ model in realistic oceanic situations is confirmed by comparison with the data-set of the Ocean Weather Ship ‘Papa’.}

We here consider the numerical solution of the compressible Reynolds-averaged {N}avier–{S}tokes and k–ω turbulence model equations by means of DG space discretization and implicit time integration. Detailed description of the DG discretization of the viscous part of the equations and of several implementation details of the k–ω turbulence model are given. To assess the performance of the proposed methodology we present the results obtained in the computation of the turbulent flow over a flat plate and of the turbulent unsteady wake developing behind a turbine blade.}

title = "Local discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Stokes system",
abstract = "In this paper, we introduce and analyze local discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Stokes system. For a class of shape regular meshes with hanging nodes we derive a priori estimates for the L2-norm of the errors in the velocities and the pressure. We show that optimal-order estimates are obtained when polynomials of degree k are used for each component of the velocity and polynomials of degree k - 1 for the pressure, for any k ≥ 1. We also consider the case in which all the unknowns are approximated with polynomials of degree k and show that, although the orders of convergence remain the same, the method is more efficient. Numerical experiments verifying these facts are displayed.",

  abstract = {This paper presents a discussion of some aspects of the linear stability problem for the asymptotic suction profile. An exact solution of the inviscid equation is first obtained in terms of the usual hypergeometric function and its analytical continuation. This exact solution provides both a corrected version of an earlier treatment by Freeman and an independent check on the more general method suggested for solving the inviscid equation numerically. Various approximations to the characteristic equation, and hence to the curve of neutral stability, are then considered. In particular, it is found that, in a consistent asymptotic treatment of the related adjoint problem, at least one viscous correction to the singular inviscid solution must be considered. Based on the present results for the adjoint problem, it is suggested that Tollmien's original treatment of the viscous corrections must be slightly modified.},

If a small, centred disturbance is made to the flow, at a Reynolds number which is slightly super-critical, the disturbance evolves into a wave-packet, whose amplitude satisfies a non-linear Schrfldinger equation. This equation is determined by using methods introduced for plane parallel-flow problems by Stewartson and Stuart (1), but with the additional features of a cross-flow velocity in the undisturbed motion, and an unbounded flow region normal to the bounding plate. The coefficients in the equation are determined numerically. It is shown that both line- and point-centred initial disturbances develop into localized bursts in a finite time.},

abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin is one of the most promising high order method in CFD. However, there is a surprising lack of user-friendly software based on DGM. HopeFOAM is a high order extension of OpenFOAM. This paper designed a high order discontinuous Galerkin method based RANS turbulence framework on HopeFOAM, by inheriting the principle and user interfaces. The one equation turbulence model Spalart-Allmaras is integrated into the framework. User-friendly interfaces are provided to configure turbulence parameters and choosing calculation methods. The turbulence model and wall distance calculation are discretized by high order DGM. Results show that this framework can achieve similar simulation results comparing to literature.},
