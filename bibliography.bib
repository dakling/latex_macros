	abstract = {Direct numerical simulation ({DNS}) of incompressible, spatially developing square jets in the Reynolds number range of 500–2000 is reported. The three-dimensional unsteady Navier–Stokes equations are solved using high order spatial and temporal discretization. The objective of the present work is to understand the evolution of free and forced square jets by examining the formation of large-scale structures. Coherent structures and related interactions of free jets suggest control strategies that can be used to achieve enhanced spreading and mixing of the jet with the surrounding fluid. The critical Reynolds number for the onset on unsteadiness in an unperturbed free square jet is found to be 875–900 while it reduces to the range 500–525 in the presence of small-scale perturbations. Disturbances applied at the flow inlet cause saturation of {KH}-instability and early transition to turbulence. Forced jet calculations have been carried out using varicose perturbation with amplitude of 15\%, while frequency is independently varied. Simulations show that the initial development of the square jet is influenced by the four corners leading to the appearance hairpin structures along with the formation of vortex rings. Farther downstream, adjacent vortices strongly interact leading to their rapid breakup. Excitation frequencies in the range 0.4–0.6 cause axis-switching of the jet cross-section. Results show that square jets achieve greater spreading but are less controllable in comparison to the circular ones.},

The axisymmetric shear layer rolls up in the near field of the jet forming vortex rings. The rings tilt as they convect downstream before becoming turbulent in the far field. The evolution of vortical structures reveals the presence of a helical structure in the flow field along with the occurrence of vortex pairing. The time-averaged streamwise velocity distribution shows self-similarity in the far field. The cross-streamwise distribution of the Reynolds stresses also shows weak self-similarity downstream as the flow is not fully developed within the streamwise length of the computational domain. A detailed comparison with experiments is carried out and the computed time-averaged as well as statistical data shows excellent match with the experimental results. Numerical simulation also reveals various transitions during flow evolution in the streamwise direction.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the equations governing homogeneous shear flow shows the possibility of solutions which are self-preserving at all scales of motion, and that these solutions are dependent on the initial conditions. The appropriate velocity scale is the one obtained from the turbulence kinetic energy, q2/2, while the length scale is the Taylor microscale, λ. Two cases of self-preserving flow are identified: one corresponding to constant mean shear, the other to a mean shear which is inversely proportional to time. For the first case (the only one considered in detail) the principal results of the postulated similarity are that λ is constant, while q2 varies exponentially with time. The ratio of the turbulence energy production rate to its dissipation rate remains constant. It is also shown that the energy spectra scale over all wavenumbers with q2 and λ, and that they have shapes determined by the initial conditions. The experimental evidence is generally consistent with the theory.},

This model enables the correct kinematic boundary condition to be imposed on the normal component of turbulent intensity. Hence, wall blocking is represented.

The present model agrees quite well with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The virtue of the present approach is that arbitrary ``damping functions'' are not required.",
